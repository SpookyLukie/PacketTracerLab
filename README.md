<h1>Building a Network using Packet Tracer</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
The objective of this project is to gain familiarity and competence in building a network, establishing connection to devices within and outside the network, and troubleshoot connectibity issues by utilizing the command line.
<br />


<h3>Languages and Utilities Used</h3>

- <b>Cisco Packet Tracer</b>
- <b>Command Prompt</b>

<h3>Skills Developed</h3>

- How to use Shell commands to navigate the command line interface for network devices
- How to build a network, including routers, switches, and a DNS server
- How to utilize a static ip route to establish connection across multiple networks and subnets
- Troubleshooting techniques and practices with reference to the OSI Model, including the use of shell commands such as ping, traceroute, and telnet

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 11 Pro</b>
